"It seems to be pretty rife!" So said Sir Keir Starmer before Christmas, when asked about speculation around his future as prime minister.
He was appearing in front of senior MPs on parliament's Liaison Committee at the time and it is true that he uttered those words with a smile.
Nonetheless it is extraordinary - not just that we are in this place, but that he is acknowledging it.
Sir Keir is one of only two people alive to have led the Labour Party to a general election victory – and a 174-seat majority at that. Yet just 18 months later the recurring conversation at Westminster is whether he will still be prime minister this time next year.
A fleeting observer of global politics might reasonably assume the UK should be a haven of stability: a newish government with a colossal majority and years until the next general election.
Yet it is not just the prime minister, Labour MPs and their domestic political opponents who are talking about the prime minister's vulnerability - it is being noted in foreign capitals too.
"There's another roll of the dice coming," a seasoned observer on the diplomatic circuit said to me recently.
"The same numbers might still come up. But they might not."
